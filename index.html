    <p class="intro">
        Logos are the best tools for leaving a long-lasting impression on the audience. This is why you must
        create a good logo for leaving a great impression on your audience. It eases communicating your business
        identity to a great extent. If you are a new business whose product and services haven’t reached your
        targeted audience yet, you would primarily depend on visual elements like a logo design for creating an
        impression about your brand and also for the marketing campaigns. Logos give identity to a brand that it
        uses throughout its range of activities and products. Logos, thereby, can be considered to be the face
        of a company. One of the primary purposes of creating a logo is creating a perception and image of the
        brand that it’s different from the existing alternatives available in the market, in the right way. This
        is why keeping up with the design trends is an essential element of logo design to ensure your logo
        doesn’t get obsolete and is well perceived by the public.
